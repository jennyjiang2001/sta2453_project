This folder contains the final model evaluation results for Lake Huron and Lake Simcoe.

- `Model Results - Lake Huron.png` & `Model Results - Lake Simcoe.png`: Visualization of performance metrics across four models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Neural Network), including F1 Score, AUROC (Area Under the ROC Curve), and Accuracy

- `Feature Importance`: Displays the top predictors ranked by importance for each model, which might be useful for future predictor set refinement and optimization in model development.
