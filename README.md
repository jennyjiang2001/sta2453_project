# Zooplankton Species Classification: A Model Powered by Machine Learning

## Background
Zooplankton are important bioindicators of freshwater ecosystem health, while manual classification is time-consuming and prone to observer bias. 

## Goal
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based classification model to distinguish between two visually similar zooplankton species: **Calanoid_1** and **Cyclopoid_1**.

## Data
The dataset includes images and quantitative measurements of zooplankton collected from **Lake Huron** and **Lake Simcoe**. It consists of:
- **Mosaic .tif files**: High-resolution images generated using FlowCam, capturing zooplankton morphology.
- **.csv export files**: Contain particle measurements and metadata linking each particle to its position in the mosaic.
- **Master Table**: Provides sampling contextual information for a comprehensive dataset view.
